is a lot of theory and details about Recurrent Neural Networks and Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence, but I will keep it basic here. 
<br>	<br>Deep Writing is the process by which artificial intelligence learns to create unique writing from sampled writing. With the assistance of some premade code downloaded from Github and the use of Google’s Deep Learning software called TensorFlow, your own computer will learn the language, vocabulary, and grammar of whatever you desire, and after some time has passed, it will be able to output its own unique writing.&nbsp;<br><br>Use the links here to learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" target="_blank">Deep Learning</a>, or <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/" target="_blank">Recurrent Neural Networks</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" target="_blank">Artificial Neural Networks</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a>.
<br>	<br>Before we get started, you should know that this step-by-step tutorial will only work on MacOS. Windows and other OS users can teach their computer to write poetry in this fashion, but will also require some outside knowledge on how to translate Terminal (Mac) commands to something such as Command Prompt (Windows). I have seen other tutorials that use the Anaconda software to install TensorFlow in a different way, at <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows#installing_with_anaconda" target="_blank">this link</a>.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<br>	Atom is a software that, in very basic terms, allows the user to read and edit files that mac or windows would not allow them to read/edit, such as Python files. <br>
<br>	To download Atom, visit <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">this link</a>, and click the yellow download button. This download might include some very basic installation steps, but all the steps should be labeled and explained well by the Atom Installer. <br>
<br>	Once the Atom is installed, check by locating Atom in your applications folder, or by using Spotlight Search by clicking the Command Key and Spacebar, typing “Atom”, and clicking the Enter key. If Atom successfully opens, continue on to Step #3.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p><p>TensorFlow can be installed in various different ways with different command prompts and software, such as the Anaconda software. But to make this step as simple as possible, we will be using Mac’s Terminal Application, which is already available to use on your computer.
<br>	<br>First, open Terminal by locating it in the applications folder, or by pressing the Command Key and Spacebar to open the Spotlight Search, and typing “Terminal” in and pressing the Enter key. Here is a link of what the Terminal icon looks like, in case you don’t know already. 
<br>	<br>When Terminal is opened, you can press the Command Key and the Plus Key to make the font size larger if you wish. Now it is time to write some commands. The list below tells (in order) the words you can copy and paste into Terminal. Copy each box into Terminal, and press enter after each box has been pasted into Terminal.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Command #1</strong> installs Pip in a simple package using Sudo. 
<br>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; sudo easy_install pip
</p><p><strong>Command #2</strong> has pip install TensorFlow version 1.1.0rc0 with user permissions enabled. 
<br>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; pip install tensorflow==1.1.0rc0 --user
<br></p><p><strong>Command #3</strong> checks the tensorflow version. It should say “verison:
Tensorflow 1.1.0rc0”
<br>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;pip show tensorflow
<br>
<br>	Problems are very common in this step, but there are a lot of different methods to install this program. If there is any Red Errors it might be ok, but if there are Red Errors on the last line of code in the line above where you can type, something went wrong. Command #3 will determine if you have completed this step correctly. If it is not installed correctly, try and troubleshoot the error by copying the Red Error message, and searching it into Google or another Search Engine of your liking.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

                        <h4 class="mbr-step-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">
                            <br>Insert and Manage The Sample Text</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">First, create a separate document (like in Pages, Word, or Google Docs) of all the writing you will use in this session to train the computer. For example, I made a document with all of Shakespeare’s 150+ sonnets. The more words, the better trained your computer will be. 
<br>	<br>Next, open the folder we installed earlier titled “word-rnn-tensorflow-master”. Open the subfolder titled “data”. Open another  subfolder inside “data” titled “tinyshakespeare”. Open the text file titled “input.txt”. 
<br>	<br>Now, copy everything from your document you just made, and delete all the words in the “input.txt” file, and paste the content of your document in there. Once you see that the document’s content have successfully be inserted into “input.txt”, close out of “input.txt”
<br>	<br>In the “word-rnn-tensorflow-master” folder”, locate the file titled “sample.py”. The mac software prevents you from opening it. This is why we installed Atom earlier. 
<br>	<br>Open Atom by locating it in your applications folder or by using Spotlight Search. Once Atom is opened, carefully drag “sample.py” into the middle section of the Atom application. If you do this successfully, you should see “sample.py” opened and be able to read the code. 
<br>	Scroll down slightly until you see this line of code:&nbsp;<br>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;parser.add_argument(‘-n’, type=int, default=200, help=’number of words to sample’)<br><br>This line of code determines the number of words that the computer will output after it has learned your sample text. The computer is defaulted to output only 200 words. I recommend this number to be between 1000 and 1500 for the highest quality. 
<br>	Change the default=200 to default=1500 so that it looks like this:<br>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;parser.add_argument(‘-n’, type=int, default=1500, help=’number of words to sample’)</p>

                        <h4 class="mbr-step-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">
                            <br>Train The Model</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">It’s time to reopen Terminal and write some commands like before, only these will take some time for the computer to process. Make sure your computer is charging because these computations are intensive for the computer and will drain the battery life rather quickly. The higher quality the computer, the faster the computations will be. 
<br>	<br>Just like before, copy the command in the box and paste it into Terminal. Make sure to press enter after each individual box has been pasted into Terminal.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Command #1</strong> has the system look in the requested folder. 
<br>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cd ~/desktop/word-rnn-tensorflow-master
<br><strong><br></strong><strong>Command #2</strong> has <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> run the file “tran.py”. This file will start the training process of Deep Writing, where the computer reads and learns what is in the file titled “sample.txt”:
<br>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; python train.py
<br><br>If the cursor is blinking on a line below all other writing, that means the computer is thinking. Do not close out of Terminal or type anything in Terminal while it does this. On my 2017 Macbook Pro, this Command takes about 5 to 10 minutes to completely process. If your document content is very big, for example all the works of Shakespeare rather than only his sonnets, this command might take a few hours to completely process. The longer the computer processes information, the better the outcome will be. The process will be completed when it says it has saved its progress and has finished leaning.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Now that the computer has learned the sample text you provided, it is now time to see what it can do with its new knowledge of poetry. 
<br>We will now write some more commands in Terminal using the same
<br>methods of copying what is in the box and pressing enter after each individual command has been pasted into Terminal. 
<br><br><strong>Command #1</strong> has Python run the file “sample.py”. This file will cause the computer to output the unique poetry. 
<br>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Python sample.py
<br>	<br>It may take a couple minutes, but eventually the computer will output 1500 words of poetry written in Deep Writing. After a little bit of formatting and slight polishing, its ready to been shown to the world. &nbsp;<br></p>
